#Python Input/Output
#This function first takes the input from the user and converts it into a string.
#The type of the returned object always will be <class ‘str’>.
#It does not evaluate the expression it just returns the complete statement as String, and will print it.

_Input1 = input("Enter your name\n")
print(_Input1)
print(type(_Input1))

_Input2 = int(input("Enter number\n"))
print(type(_Input2))
print(_Input2)
print(_Input2 + 100)
